# hydro_app

Mobile application for the hydroponics system.

## Building:

For the images and graphics download the graphics folder from the google drive and put it into
the root of the project.

If an image doesn't exist I probably forgot to update the drive folder.

## Firebase stuff

Get google-services.json from the firebase console for this app and put it into
`android/app/google-services.json`
